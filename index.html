      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Aldri Binzent Terrado, a passionate dancer with a strong background in IT support and a current resident of Singapore. Dance has been an integral part of my life, and it’s where I find both joy and creativity. With years of experience in the IT industry, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and artistic expression to everything I do.

        Currently, I work in the fast-paced world of IT support in Singapore, troubleshooting and optimizing systems for seamless digital experiences. But my heart always beats to the rhythm of dance! Whether it’s ballet, hip-hop, or contemporary, I’m constantly exploring new forms and styles that allow me to express myself and connect with others.

        Alongside my love for dance, I’m diving deep into the world of web development. I’m passionate about learning new technologies and building creative, functional websites. Every day is an opportunity to expand my skills and merge my technical knowledge with my creative passions.

        I believe in the power of continuous learning, whether it's refining my dance moves, troubleshooting a system error, or creating beautiful web interfaces. This balance between technology and artistry is what drives me to keep growing and evolving in everything I do.
